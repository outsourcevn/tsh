                    <p class=contentDetail>
						People with a Life Path number 3 have a very high level of creativity and self expression.

                    <h2>Your Life Path Number 4</h2>
                    <p class=contentDetail>
						People with a Life Path number 4 are the worker bees of society. If your Life Path is a 4 you are determined, practical and hard working. Down-to-earth is a term that is probably often used to describe you. You find hard work rewarding and don't look for the easy way to the top or to finding success. Not only do you work hard yourself, but you expect the same from those around you. 

						The Fours like to be organized, and to put things back in their " proper place" … it is one of their strong points, and they feel better able to tackle challenges if they have a solid plan in place beforehand. They tend to be set in their ways and are drawn to leading an orderly life ie. "a place for everything and everything in its place." Home is their haven, and if their home environment appears sloppy and unkempt, that is a sign that a Life Path 4 person is not doing well. 

						They are usually very cerebral and need to find ways to relax their minds. Otherwise, great ideas live and die in their heads. They have a strong sense of right and wrong, are very honest, and value honesty in others. Fours' dreams are based in reality and they never question that you will have to work hard to make them come true. Loyal and very dependable, they make an excellent friend or partner, but may have just a small circle of friends. 

						On the negative side, Fours can be so set in their ways that they can often come across as stubborn, rigid or too serious. They also have a tendency to overlook tact and let their true feelings be known to all those around them, which can sometimes turn other people away from them. Although practical and good planners, Fours are extremely cautious, and don't deviate much from their master plan, and because of this can sometimes miss opportunities that arise because they don't act on them quickly enough. 

						Life path number 4 is about putting all the pieces together, it is a builder number. You are grounded, serious, hardworking, analytical, practical and disciplined. Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						You are the practical, content one in the crowd. You are probably drawn to building or construction, although you would also be a good lawyer, mechanic, engineer or accountant. Whatever path you choose, don't hesitate to teach those around you. 

						Don't let yourself get bored or boring. You have a tendency towards complacency when you think everything is under control. Don't let it blind you to new opportunities and projects. 

						You'll lean towards depression and fatigue if you don't get enough fun and relaxation. Relaxing isn't one of your talents, so do something active to recharge. Go to Disneyland and see how many rides you can do in one day. Backpacking might be just the thing for you. 

						You would probably enjoy volunteering in some way. Look for something that lets you pass on your skills to others.

                    <h2>Your Life Path Number 5</h2>
                    <p class=contentDetail>
						Those with a Life Path of 5 seek freedom above all else. They are adventurers, having a restless nature, and being on the go, constantly seeking change and variety in life. They have a free spirit and need to have variety in their day. If they do not live the adventure, their lives become way too dramatic. 

						They love meeting new people, trying new things, and living life for today, and curiosity leads them to constantly try to find the answers to life's questions. "Conservative" is a word that is probably never used to describe them, as they love taking risks, and hate routine and repetition. 

						Fives have a hard time settling down and have a fear of being trapped or smothered in a relationship. Their love of freedom extends beyond concern only for their own freedom, and they have a genuine concern for the freedom and welfare of others. Although Fives are extremely compassionate, their focus on adventure and curiosity can also distract them and keep them from being aware of the feelings of those around them. Furthermore, because they are always seeking the next adventure, their life can lack direction, and this can cause them to become discontent and impatient. 

						Fives are very persuasive and excel at motivating people which makes them ideal candidates to become salesmen. Any career requiring travel is also a great fit for those with Life Path number 5, since it will keep them away from the routine of many other jobs, otherwise they may feel a sense of restlessness if they get stuck in a mundane or repetitive job environment. Fives are also very versatile, which makes many other career choices suitable for them. A person with a lot of 5's in their chart will want to be their own boss. This person will not enjoy working a 9 to 5 job where they have to report to someone else each day. 

						Life path number 5 is the number of freedom and change. Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						Don't try to deny who you are. Security is a great thing, but you need your escapes. Find a way to satisfy that wandering urge or you'll be miserable. 

						Aim for a career that lets you have adventures. You are capable of great originality in both thought and action. You could do something as dramatic as being a photographer for National Geographic or as simple as being a flight attendant. 

						You can be self-indulgent, especially if you let yourself get bored. Allow yourself to enjoy your spirit of adventure and you'll be able to find excitement in a walk around the block. If you can't travel, at least try new restaurants. 

						You are sensual, but don't bask in it. Don't forget to learn about yourself and other people while you explore.

                    <h2>Your Life Path Number 6</h2>
                    <p class=contentDetail>
						Those born with a Life Path number 6 are incredible nurturers. If men, they rescue damsels in distress. If women, they mother the "little boy" in their men. 

						If you have a six in your chart you are home, family, or community oriented, loving, warm, understanding, compassionate, responsible and reliable and interested in pleasing others. You are an excellent caretaker and provider, and enjoy being of service to others, and this is especially true with your family and friends. You life revolves around home and family, and your parenting instincts are very strong. The word domestic most likely describes you well, and one job you would love is being a stay at home parent. 

						As a Six you should keep an eye on yourself as you may become self-righteous and critical of others. Because you are so giving you might have a tendency to become a slave to others and neglect your own needs in the process. Because you thrive on supporting others you may sometimes find it difficult to find a balance between helping and meddling. You may also become an enabler for someone who needs taking care of in a relationship, or with a child, and not allow them to experience life or learn its lessons. People born on the Sixth path are often described as magnetic, as people are often drawn to them, and their moods can affect the room. 

						Your tendency is to be a humanitarian and you feel a genuine devotion to the welfare of your fellow human beings, but you must be careful of putting people on pedestals, as they often have a tendency to topple. 

						Life path number 6 is the number of responsibility and awareness. When those around you are losing their heads, you're the one who takes charge. Stop fighting it. Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						Don't try to deny who you are. You are a take charge person. You have two choices. You can accept it and get over it and do it right and actually enjoy it. Or, you can give up control and know that you'll be critical of the way anyone else handles things. You're probably a control freak. That's OK, there are a lot of us out there. Just have a sense of humor about it. Remember, you're a legend in your own mind! Now, keep reading. 

						Appreciate yourself. Aim for a career that rewards your responsibility. You'll do much better as a manager than as a worker. If it means more education, then get it. Be proud of yourself for being capable. 

						Remember that the person in charge is only as good as the people doing the grunt work. Be compassionate, practical and appreciative. And make sure that you know how to do each person's job, so that you know what you're asking them to do. 

						You might want to make your vacations as control-free as possible. Someplace like Club Med or a cruise might be perfect for you. Give yourself a few days where the only decisions you have to make are if you're hungry or thirsty and what you want to do about it. Let the people in charge take care of you for a change. Just make sure you know they're going to do it properly. 

						Another vacation option is to do something very physical. Go someplace and help build a cabin, or a house. Do a seven-day backpacking or bicycle trip. The idea is to do something physically fairly strenuous for a week or so. Or huge, like train for and run a marathon. Make yourself tired. Just make sure you spend a couple of days recovering.

                    <h2>Your Life Path Number 7</h2>
                    <p class=contentDetail>
						Seven is another cerebral number, and those with a Life Path number 7 have a loner quality. They need to learn to have faith. If they do not have faith they tend to become very cynical and escape through drugs, alcohol, work, and geography. They have a love of natural beauty: ocean, green grass, plants, flowers, etc. . . 

						Sevens have an air of mystery and do not want you to know who they are. Intellectual, analytical, intuitive, reserved, natural inclination towards spiritual subjects, aloof, loner, pessimistic, secretive, and insecure; are some of the qualities of those born into the Seventh Life path. A person who is a Life Path 7 is a thinker. If your Life Path is a 7 you are wise and studious. You seek truth and wisdom in all that you do, and search for the underlying answers in everything. Your tendency is to be a perfectionist, and you expect the same from those around you. 

						Because you are most comfortable by yourself, a loner or introvert, you happily give up the stress and turmoil of a busy life in favor of a quiet, peaceful life of solitude. 7 is a spiritual number, and most 7's are drawn to spiritual pursuits. 

						Your love of solitude can make it difficult for you to form close relationships. While you value your independence you may often feel lonely or isolated because you lack closeness with others. Because you spend so much time alone, you may lose your consideration for others and become inflexible. One of the challenges for you is to find a balance between maintaining your solitude while not becoming completely isolated. Seven represents spiritual focus, analysis, being original, independent; If you have this number people often feel like they don't know you; you are a mystery, and some may see you as eccentric. 

						Life path number 7 is the number of a higher awareness, a wider point of view. When all around you are admiring the trees, you're absorbed in the forest. Your lesson is to train yourself to see both. Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						You may be afraid of heights, but your heart soars like an eagle. You probably will always see more widely than most around you. Oddly enough, this can also lead to a seeming lack of attention to detail. Don't ignore the details. 

						Another way to describe your view of life is that you're frequently in touch with "the force." The energy of the world can seem like a pond with a mostly smooth surface. Watch the surface for ripples; many of them are caused by opportunities coming within reach. 

						You have a stable core, but the exterior can keep your friends and family guessing. You'll more than likely have several careers during your lifetime, or you'll find a way to keep it different and refreshing while you're doing it. If you owned a restaurant, the menu would probably change monthly, even daily. 

						Make your vacations into mini-adventures or learning expeditions. Take a workshop on something you've always wanted to learn and immerse yourself in it. Or, visit a place you've always been curious about and do the same. 

						There's a good chance you'd love learning to fly

                    <h2>Your Life Path Number 8</h2>
                    <p class=contentDetail>
						People with a Life Path number 8 do not feel safe unless they have found a way to establish financial security. 

						It is difficult for an Eight to take advice. When they make a choice, they must feel it is their decision, NOT SOMEONE ELSES. As a result, they do tend to learn the hard way. Eights are very honest and by being so blunt, they unintentionally hurt feelings. Although they can sometimes appear insensitive, what is going on inside them is the exact opposite. They do feel deeply about everything that goes on in their lives. People with a Life Path 8 are born with natural leadership skills. If your Life Path is an 8 you are very ambitious and goal oriented. You have strong organizational skills and broad vision which make you successful in business. 

						Eight represents authority, material wealth, ambition, and caution. A person with the number 8 in their chart will work diligently to achieve their goals. This person would make a good business manager and leader. They thrive on hard work, and more than any other Life Path number are prone to becoming a workaholic. They are very good with money and their work ethic makes it possible for them to acquire wealth. This pursuit of materialistic gains can hold some pitfalls for them, including a tendency to become unscrupulous in their efforts to make money, or neglect of their family and loved ones while working to earn money. 

						If you are an Eight, you are a good judge of character and attract the right kind of people to work with you toward your vision. This makes you a natural executive and excellent in the business or political arena. You have a need for success, and a strong desire to be recognized for your achievements. 

						Because you consider status very important you may be tempted to live above your means. You should also pay special attention to telling and showing your loved ones that you care - being a good provider isn't the only way of doing this. 

						Life Path number 8 is also a number of returning karma and opportunity. You are reviewing the lessons you've brought from other lifetimes, and reinforcing what you choose to keep. Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						The eight life path is the time to learn what really matters. Things of dishonesty in the past may present themselves again in this lifetime. Even important choices that you made well may revisit you. 

						Eight has a built-in sense of the relationship between the past, present and future. It's almost impossible for you to look at a situation and not also see what probably led to it and what will happen next. You can probably see the best way to improve the situation, too. 

						You'll probably have a recurring pattern of people entering, leaving and returning to you. Things and people just have a way of returning to you eventually. 

						You could be a wonderful counselor, helping other people to see the patterns and recurring events of their lives. You also probably have the compassion to do it, just remember that sometimes your direct honesty can be hard to take. 

						Know that another possible interest or career could be anything involving history and antiques. You could be the guy with great stories down at the local antique store, or some body's high school history teacher

                    <p class=contentDetail>
						Those born with a Life Path number 9 are natural leaders, and they assume they are in charge even if they are not. If in a department store, people think they work there. They take care of everyone else but need to learn to speak up when they need help, love, and hugs. Nines often feel unloved or abandoned by their mother or father, or they feel completely responsible for them. It's hard for them to let go of the past. 

						People with a Life Path 9 are humanitarians. If your Life Path is a 9 you have an extremely strong sense of compassion and generosity. You are selfless and helping others is very important to you. You not only want to help others, but you feel very deeply for those less fortunate than yourself. 

						You are friendly and people like you. Your generosity knows no bounds, and you give freely of your money, time and energy. Your ultimate goal is working toward a better world. 

						Because you are so giving you may find that your finances are not in the greatest shape. You may also have a tendency to be scattered … your talents lie in so many different directions that you may find it difficult to focus on just one. If you are not following your Life Path and are instead pursuing materialistic gains, you could feel a deep level of dissatisfaction with yourself. 

						Number 9 symbolizes endings, spiritual consciousness. An individual with a Life Path number 9 can overcome a lot, and is often required to do so in their lifetime. If you have a Life Path Number 9 you most likely had a difficult relationship with one or both of your parents early in your life. 

						Life path number 9 is the number of completion and resolution. You will need to make choices, and not resist endings. Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						Your biggest battle in life is with endings and completion. You hate to see things finish, but you also are tempted to just end things so that it's on your terms. Just take it as it comes. 

						Learn that every ending contains a beginning. You might do best with a career that lets you start and finish multiple projects. You'll get better at seeing the continuum of the process rather than the beginnings and endings. 

						You may have a tendency to end relationships every time you encounter a rough patch. Teach yourself to see those situations as temporary. It's worth sticking to a commitment for many reasons, including just because you said you would. Don't always take the easy way out. 

						Gardening may be a healing thing for you. Not house plants, but food, things that have a season. You'll enjoy seeing the progress throughout the year and knowing that it is a constantly revolving wheel.

						Individuals with the Life Path number 11 are very intuitive, in fact it is the most intuitive of all numbers.

For example, they will pick up on people's relationships and health without being told anything. They are here to use their gifts of intuition, and sensitivity to help others. 

						Life path of 11 has the qualities of the number two magnified. If you have this number you are spiritually aware, a visionary, inspiring, charismatic, inventive, a dreamer, idealistic, and a deep thinker, and you rely on faith rather than logic to deal with the life and all it has to offer. 

						The challenge for Elevens is to not be overwhelmed by their gifts. Fears and phobias would be the downside of this number. They may also seem at times indecisive, impractical, nervous, and moody. 

						The number 11 life path is concerned with spiritual illumination. Often a number 11 will have an instinctive understanding of metaphysical matters. Because Elevens are also Twos, , they have the strength to finish what they start. 11 is also a good number for forming partnerships … you work and play well with others. You are likely to marry young and be committed and faithful for your entire life. 

						Below are some key points you might want to take into consideration to help you on your path … 

						An 11 may appear to lead a life of extremes. It is really a search for balance in all areas of life. 11s are avant-garde and visionary individuals who make great students, psychics, mystics, healers, teachers, writers, musicians and artists. 

						You probably like habit and routine, it gives you a foundation from which you can explore. You might not be a leader, but you are a visionary and a very talented idea person. Your ability to quickly and accurately analyze a situation is a real strength in the business world. You are a perfectionist, but you usually measure up. 

						An unhappy 11 will find themselves always dreaming of big schemes, but never taking practical action to pursue those goals. This means the 11 is stuck in the "visionary" stage of enlightenment, and probably needs to address fear issues. 

						An 11/2 can be your own worst enemy. You're driven to perfection, but sometimes that just means you're on a carousel that won't stop. Learn to call it a day and don't get caught in self-blame.
